To the Task to generate quality ideas out of many Input ideas of mostly lower quality, we define the following needs and requirements:

- an overview over the ideas
- put ideas together, similarity, relation
- place ideas on a Board, to have an overview and to organize and sort ideas
- put non-useful ideas away, aside
- to have Clusters as Containers of ideas, to move them around as well
- name Clusters
- write text, create new "quality" ideas
- Search for ideas, with specific keywords
- quick and easy moves ideas and clusters
- work together with others on the same idea space:
  _ discuss ideas on the board and new ideas (every one should see the borad and read the ideas)
  _ each one can access the App on the same state form their laptop

## Application

- bring ideas in relation, build Clusters, summerize and fliter them to generate quality ideas from that.
