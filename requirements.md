## Requirements

To the Task to generate quality ideas out of many Input ideas of mostly lower quality, we define the following needs and requirements:

### General

- an overview over the ideas, to see the whole idea space at a glance, (solution: display ideas and clusters as dots, show content on hower)
- place ideas on a Board, to have an overview, to organize and sort ideas
- put non-useful ideas away, aside
- put ideas together in clusters, due to similarity and relation
- set them in relation across clusters, set **labels** on ideas
- to have Clusters as Containers of ideas, to move them around as whole
- give names to Clusters
- write text, _create new "quality" ideas_, relate them to other existing ideas
- write _notes_ on existing ideas
- Search for ideas, with specific keywords, (include detected concepts)
- quick and easyily move ideas and clusters on the board
- save the State of the idea space
  - export State as json
  - save State localy
  - save State in database, to have multiple sessions for different ideas, different problems.

### Working Together on many Ideas:

- work together on the same idea space:
  - discuss ideas on the board and new ideas (every one should see the borad and read the ideas)
  - talk about one specific idea or cluster, there for the Object should be _displayed_ readable and in full size.
  - each one can access the App on the same State form their laptop, to work concurrently on the same idea space.
