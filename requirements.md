## Requirements

To the Task to generate quality ideas out of many Input ideas of mostly lower quality, we define the following needs and requirements:

### General

- an overview over the ideas
- put ideas together in clusters, due to similarity and relation
- set them in relation across clusters, set **lables** on ideas
- place ideas on a Board, to have an overview, to organize and sort ideas
- put non-useful ideas away, aside
- to have Clusters as Containers of ideas, to move them around as well
- name Clusters
- write text, _create new "quality" ideas_, relate them to others
- write _notes_ on existing ideas
- Search for ideas, with specific keywords
- quick and easyily move ideas and clusters on the board

### Working Together on many Ideas:

- work together the same idea space:
  - discuss ideas on the board and new ideas (every one should see the borad and read the ideas)
  - talk about one specific idea or cluster, there for the Object should be _displayed_ readable and in full size.
  - each one can access the App on the same State form their laptop, to work concurrently on the same board.
